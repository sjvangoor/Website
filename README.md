# Website

This repository contains a polished portfolio website for **Jamy Fox**. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the About Me page. The navigation menu links to several pages:

- `index.html` – About me
- `skills.html` – Skills
- `projects.html` – Projects
- `ambition.html` – Ambition
- `contact.html` – Contact

The site uses Google Fonts and modern CSS for a high-end look. A built-in dark mode toggle lets visitors switch themes. Customize the placeholder text with your own details.
